# Introduction to Gainswap

## What is Gainswap

Gainswap is a next-generation on-chain liquidity solution that uses Generative Market Making (GMM) algorithms to provide pure on-chain, contract-composable liquidity.Gainswap has made many improvements based on Uniswap.

## What are the problems with Uniswap

* High slippage
* Low utilisation of funds

## How does Gainswap work

* Deposit idle funds from LPs for mining
* Slippage always outperforms Uniswap through virtual liquidity

## Why Gainswap

* Low slippage
* No protocols fee
* Idle funds buy back GAIN for an additional fee, allowing GAIN prices to rise

## What can I do with Gainswap

### As a trader
* Each and every trader enjoys sufficient liquidity similar to that of centralized exchanges
* Arbitrageurs can profit from price discrepancies between Gainswap and other exchanges
* Smart contracts can natively use Gainswap liquidity to complete on-chain transactions, such as liquidation and auctions

### As a LP

* There are no minimal deposit requirements and restrictions on asset types
* Gainswap charges a fee for each transaction and eventually distributes it to LPs as rewards
* LP liquidity mining is more lucrative as Gainswap has the ability to mine with idle funds to buy back Gains
* LPs can obtain liquidity by depositing their tokens they already own, without taking on price risk

## Token Allocation

* Total 30,000 pieces

* Initial liquidity 60%, fully injected into the pool, locked in for one year, then voted on for unlocking after one year

* Mining 30%

* Team 8%, released over time, released in one year

* Airdrop 2%

* Destroy Platform Proceeds 100% Destroy Platform Coins
